# Objective

In this Project we are made aware of the the difference between Imperative Programming and Declaritive Programming. Since they are very important to understand . They want us to understand the style of our coding approach more and problem solving approach. 

# Challenges

At first i thought the second example was the imperative one but i soon realized that i was wrong when i went too deep and reseached more. 

# Improvements

I will now implement this two ways of programming style when i write my codes so that i can understand the difference more further. 

# Conclusion

This Project was very Important since we have been coding using this styles but we were not aware if they are programming paradigms. They teach us to understand coding more and which style to go with when we code and at what approach can we solve a problem.
